# SEVEN Digital Studio

Welcome to the SEVEN Digital Studio codebase.

## Overview

A professional, lightweight, and scalable website for a digital agency serving the Ghanaian market.
Built with **Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS** for maximum speed, easy hosting on Hostinger, and low maintenance.

## Quick Start

1.  Navigate to the `public` folder.
2.  Open `index.html` in your browser.
3.  Deploy by uploading the contents of `public/` to your web server's `public_html`.

## Documentation

- [Architecture & Folder Structure](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md)
- [Design System & Tokens](docs/DESIGN.md) (Coming Soon)

## Architecture Highlights

- **No Build Tools**: Simple ES Modules and standard CSS `@import`.
- **Data-Driven**: Content for repeated elements (pricing, testimonials) is stored in `public/data/*.json`.
- **Future-Proof**: Structure allows for adding independent API or Admin folders later.
